# InfiniteCatFacts
### SwiftUI + MVVM (Combine)

InfiniteCatFacts is a simple iOS app that displays a random cat fact and an image of a cat. 

Each time the user clicks the *Next* button:

⋅ the app retrieves a new random fact and a new cat image URL, 

⋅ the app retrieves the cat image itself from that URL.

The app uses the Cat API to fetch the random fact and image. 
The app fetches the image URL first, and then fetches the image itself once the URL is received.
