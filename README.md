# InfiniteCatFacts
### SwiftUI + MVVM (Combine)

InfiniteCatFacts is a simple iOS app that displays a random cat fact and a corresponding image of a cat. 

Each time the user taps the "Next fact" button, the app fetches a new random fact and a new image.

The app uses the Cat API to fetch the random fact and image. 
The app fetches the image URL first, and then fetches the image itself once the URL is received.
